## Description

Fit beta-binomial regression using the adjusted score functions to  median bias reduction (Kenne Pagui et al., 2017) and mean bias reduction (Firth, 1993). Both approaches are effective in solving the boundary estimate problem that may arise for maximum likelihood in beta-binomial regression.

## Authors

The mbrbetareg implementation has been written by Euloge Clovis Kenne Pagui (kenne@stat.unipd.it), Nicola Sartori (sartori@stat.unipd.it) and Alessandra Salvan (salvan@stat.unipd.it) from the University of Padova.
